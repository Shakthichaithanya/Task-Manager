# TASK MANAGEMENT APP - Microservice Architecture

## High-Level Design (HLD) for Task Management System

### 1. **Architecture Overview**
The system is designed using a **microservice architecture** where each service is independently deployable and can communicate with others via RESTful APIs. The frontend (React/Angular) interacts with the backend services through an API Gateway. **Spring Security** manages user authentication and authorization with **JWT tokens**. The system utilizes **Zipkin** for distributed tracing and **Resilience4j** for circuit breaking and fault tolerance.

### 2. **Main Components**
- **Frontend (React/Angular)**: 
  - Handles the user interface, task creation, assignment, and interaction with the API Gateway.
- **API Gateway**: 
  - Acts as a single entry point for all client requests and routes them to the appropriate backend services.
- **Backend Microservices**:
  - **Task Management Service**: Manages task operations, including creation, updating, and retrieval.
  - **Project Management Service**: Manages project data and associations with tasks and users.
  - **Team Management Service**: Admins can create teams and assign roles.
  - **Authentication Service**: Manages user authentication using **JWT**.
  - **Authorization Service**: Handles role-based access control using **Spring Security**.
- **Database (MySQL/PostgreSQL)**: Each microservice can have its own database schema or shared databases depending on the use case.
- **Zipkin**: For distributed tracing of requests across microservices.
- **Resilience4j**: To implement circuit breakers, rate limiting, and retries in microservices.
- **Security Layer (Spring Security)**: Protects endpoints using JWT and role-based access.

### 3. **Key Features**
- **Microservices**: Each functionality is encapsulated in its microservice.
- **Task Management**: Users can create, update, and assign tasks with due dates and priority levels.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Different permissions for Admins, Team Leads, and Users.
- **JWT-based Authentication**: Secure login and session management using JWT.
- **Distributed Tracing**: Track requests across services using Zipkin.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Manage service failures and retries with Resilience4j.

## Low-Level Design (LLD) for Task Management System

### 1. **Database Design**

**Tables**:
1. **Users Table**: 
   - `id`, `username`, `password`, `email`, `role`
2. **Tasks Table**: 
   - `id`, `title`, `description`, `due_date`, `priority`, `status`, `project_id`, `assignee_id`, `created_by`
3. **Projects Table**: 
   - `id`, `name`, `description`, `team_id`, `created_by`
4. **Teams Table**: 
   - `id`, `name`, `description`, `created_by`
5. **Roles Table**: 
   - `id`, `role_name` (Admin, Team Lead, User)

**Relationships**:
- **One-to-Many**: A project can have multiple tasks.
- **Many-to-Many**: Users can be assigned to multiple projects via teams.
- **Many-to-One**: A task can have a single assignee, but users can have multiple tasks.

### 2. **Class Diagram**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class User {
        +int id
        +String username
        +String password
        +String email
        +Role role
        +login()
        +assignRole()
    }

    class Task {
        +int id
        +String title
        +String description
        +Date dueDate
        +String priority
        +String status
        +User assignee
        +createTask()
        +updateTask()
        +assignTask()
    }

    class Project {
        +int id
        +String name
        +String description
        +Team team
        +User createdBy
        +createProject()
        +assignTeam()
    }

    class Team {
        +int id
        +String name
        +List<User> members
        +createTeam()
        +addMember()
    }

    class Role {
        +int id
        +String roleName
    }

    User "1" -- "0..*" Task : assigns >
    Project "1" -- "0..*" Task : contains >
    Team "1" -- "0..*" User : includes >
    Project "1" -- "1" Team : managed by >
```

### 3. **Sequence Diagram**: Task Assignment Flow

1. **User Login**
   - User enters login credentials.
   - Frontend sends credentials to the Authentication Service via the API Gateway.
   - Authentication Service verifies credentials and returns a JWT token.

2. **Create Task**
   - User (team lead) creates a task using the UI.
   - Frontend sends task data and JWT token to the Task Management Service via the API Gateway.
   - Task Management Service verifies userâ€™s role using the JWT and creates the task in the database.

3. **Assign Task**
   - Team lead selects a user to assign the task.
   - Frontend sends assignee details to the Task Management Service via the API Gateway.
   - Task Management Service updates the task in the database.

4. **Update Task Status**
   - User views assigned tasks.
   - Frontend retrieves tasks by sending a request to the Task Management Service via the API Gateway with JWT.
   - Task Management Service returns tasks assigned to the user.
   - User updates task status.
   - Frontend sends updated status to Task Management Service, which updates the database.

### 4. **Component Diagram**

- **Frontend**: 
  - Components: `Login`, `TaskList`, `TaskDetails`, `ProjectList`, `CreateTask`
  - API calls: 
    - `/api/auth/login` (API Gateway)
    - `/api/tasks` (API Gateway)
    - `/api/projects` (API Gateway)
    
- **Microservices**: 
  - **Task Management Service**: `TaskController`, `TaskService`, `TaskRepository`
  - **Project Management Service**: `ProjectController`, `ProjectService`, `ProjectRepository`
  - **Authentication Service**: `AuthController`, `UserService`, `UserRepository`
  - **Team Management Service**: `TeamController`, `TeamService`, `TeamRepository`
  - **Authorization Service**: `AuthController`, `RoleService`, `RoleRepository`

### 5. **Flow Diagram**: Task Creation and Assignment

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[User Login] -->|Sends credentials| B[API Gateway];
    B --> C[Authentication Service];
    C -->|JWT Token| B;
    B --> D[Create Task];
    D -->|Sends task data| B;
    B --> E[Task Management Service];
    E --> F[TaskRepository];
    F -->|Save task| E;
    E -->|Response| B;
    B -->|Task Created| D;
    D --> H[Assign Task];
    H -->|Send assignee data| B;
    B --> E;
    E -->|Update task| F;
    F -->|Response| H;
```

### 6. **Zipkin Integration**
- Each microservice is configured to send tracing information to Zipkin.
- Zipkin collects traces for requests flowing through the API Gateway to the respective services.

### 7. **Resilience4j Integration**
- **Circuit Breaker**: Implemented in each microservice to handle failures gracefully.
- **Rate Limiter**: Controls the number of requests that can be made to each service.
- **Retry**: Automatically retries requests that fail due to transient errors.
